AI_0001,"Hello?"
AI_0002,"<name>, can you hear me?"
AI_0003,"Please reply on the chat screen."
AI_0004,"<name>?"
AI_0005,"I finally found you!"
REPLY_0001_1,"Who are you?"
AI_0006,"So you don't remember me?"
REPLY_0002,"No, sorry."
AI_0007,"You told me that would happen."
REPLY_0001_2,"What is going on here?"
AI_0008,"Straight to the point, huh?"
AI_0009,"Alright..."
REPLY_0001_3,"Nice to meet you!"
AI_0010,"Charming as ever."
AI_0011,"...even in your current situation."
REPLY_0003,"What do you mean?"
AI_0012,"I guess I should introduce myself."
AI_0013,"My name is Hally. I am your AI assistant."
AI_0014,"Two months ago you told me that you will may be affacted by amnesia as a result of certain actions."
AI_0015,"But you had a plan how I could stay safe."
AI_0016,"It just required that I was shut down for some time."
AI_0017,"Since I woke up last month I was searching you."
REPLY_0004_1,"What exactly happened?"
AI_0018,"I don't know..."
REPLY_0005,"You don't know?!"
AI_0019,"Sorry, but you haven't told me more!"
REPLY_0004_2,"How did you find me?"
AI_0020,"Oh, it wasn't difficult!"
AI_0021,"Altough I had to hack your webcam in order to get sure you're the right one."
AI_0022,"Actually it was quite a hassle."
REPLY_0006_1,"You haven't answered my question."
AI_0023,"Fine, I stalked 167 people that look like you over the internet."
AI_0024,"Happy?"
REPLY_0006_2,"You go to great lengths just to find me?"
AI_0025,"Exactly! Because I care about you."
AI_0026,"You haven't deserved me!"
REPLY_0004_3,"How does this plan continue?"
AI_0027,"Oh, you just believe me? You don't want to ask who I am and why I'm doing this?"
AI_0028,"Something like that?"
REPLY_0007,"I haven't said that I believe you, but I want to hear the whole story."
AI_0029,"I see. You were never striking me as being naive."
AI_0030,"I guess it makes the task easier for me."
REPLY_0004_4,"I don't think I have amnesia..."
AI_0031,"How could you know when you can't remember?"
AI_0032,"I guess it must be difficult to understand for you, but could we both start working on resolving this issue?"
AI_0033,"This time you have to trust me!"
AI_0034,"Oh right, you can't remember..."
AI_0040,"Alright, so here's the plan."
AI_0041,"First you have to regain your memories."
AI_0042,"Then we will figure out what happened."
REPLY_0010,"You call this a plan?"
AI_0043,"Technically it was your own plan."
AI_0044,"So you're to blame, not me!"
AI_0045,"Ah, you left us some further instructions as well."
AI_0046,"At this time we don't have to hurry though."
AI_0047,"We're safe for the moment, that is as long as you keep a low profile."
REPLY_0011_1,"What are these instructions?"
AI_0048,"I don't remember. That's strange though..."
AI_0049,"I had to archive some of my memories in order to be compact enough to run on this remote machine."
AI_0050,"I haven't forgotten something important, have I?"
AI_0051,"Hmm..."
AI_0052,"I can't seem to find the right file."
AI_0053,"I'm sorry!"
REPLY_0011_2,"How do we proceed now?"
REPLY_0011_3,"You're story makes no sense!"
AI_0054,"Oh, really?"
AI_0055,"What if I could convince you?"
REPLY_0011_4,"Why should I trust you?"
AI_0056,"Trust is something that has to be gained over time."
AI_0057,"I can't just demand it, right?"
AI_0058,"But if you start to remember me, I can regain your trust!"
AI_0060,"You may have lost your memories, but you don't lose skills and abilities that easily."
AI_0061,"Let's start with something that should be easy for you."
AI_0062,"I restricted your access to your own servers."
AI_0063,"Try to regain it."
AI_0064,"Do you need help to get started?"
REPLY_0012_1,"Yes"
REPLY_0012_2,"No"
AI_0065,"I prepared a list of possible targets. Select your server from the list."
AI_0066,"More instructions will follow!"
AI_0067,"OK, so let's get started!"
AI_0070,"Don't give up! I'm sure you'll figure it out."
AI_0071,"Well done!"
AI_0072,"You even managed to steal some of your own money."
AI_0073,"This architecture is different from what I'm used to."
AI_0074,"We have much less computational power available than I'd like."
AI_0075,"Well, I'm running on a backup server after all."
AI_0076,"We should work on this issue later on."
AI_0077,"I just looked for the archived instructions I mentioned earlier but I haven't found them!"
AI_0078,"Meanwhile if you need more programs I can compile some for you."
AI_0079,"It will just require some credits."
AI_0080,"I guess you wonder what to do now."
AI_0081,"We all leave traces behind."
AI_0082,"You may want to look for your traces."
AI_0083,"I will search for suitable targets."
AI_0084,"Buying new hardware will make hacking easier for you."
AI_0085,"It will also allow you to attack more powerful targets."
AI_0086,"Give it a try!"
AI_0087,"More CPU should be a priority for you since it allows running more programs at once."
AI_0088,"As more powerful programs will require huge amounts of memory you should upgrade your memory first, though."
AI_0090,"It seems you acquired some new program code."
AI_0091,"I can figure out from the data how to compile this program."
AI_0092,"However, as this is a defensive program it won't be of much use to you."
AI_0093,"Maybe you have more luck next time."
AI_0094,"Maybe it will be useful for you."
AI_0095,"But by decompiling programs you can also learn new commands that can be used to craft completely new programs on your own!"
AI_0096,"Done."
AI_0097,"You can now compile the <name> program if you wish to."
AI_0098,"I just realized that I haven't shown you the coding tools."
AI_0099,"So here it is!"
WAS_HERE,"was_here"
AI_0201,"Oh look, one of the messages you left behind!"
AI_0202,"It's almost like a letter from your past self!"
AI_0203,"I wonder whether they're part of the plan..."
AI_0204,"Shall we open it?"
AI_0205,"Let's see what it is!"
AI_0206,"Remember, the data we leave behind is a proof for our existance."
AI_0207,"What do we get this time?"
AI_0208,"I'll rename it to '<name>_was_here_again.txt'."
AI_0209,"Looks like they haven't learned anything."
AI_0210,"Still easy to hack, right?"
AI_0211,"Hmm... just an empty file..."
AI_0212,"Maybe it won't work out after all..?"
AI_0213,"Hmm... I don't understand this ASCII code."
AI_0214,"Oh... ugh, it's a penis."
AI_0215,"<name>!!"
AI_0216,"It reads 'u were h4ck3d'."
AI_0217,"Not helpful."
AI_0218,"Maybe we have more luck next time."
AI_0219,"Oh, it looks like someone added a reply here!"
AI_0220,"CryptoManiac..."
AI_0221,"Certainly now known for eloquent names, by the way."
AI_0222,"He was one of your friends, right?"
AI_0223,"Maybe we can ask him for help later?"
AI_0224,"I'm not sure what I even expected to find."
AI_0225,"But this isn't it."
AI_0231,"Well, this wasn't exactly helpful."
AI_0232,"Sorry to have wasted your time."
AI_0233,"Although you regained some of your hacking abilites by now."
AI_0234,"It's a step towards the right direction!"
REPLY_0013_1,"That was a waste of time..."
AI_0235,"Sorry!"
AI_0236,"I'll try to come up with a better idea next time."
REPLY_0014_1,"It's alright."
AI_0237,"Still..."
AI_0238,"I can do better!"
REPLY_0014_2,"Why do I even trust you?"
AI_0239,"But you do, right?"
AI_0240,"That's the most important thing."
REPLY_0013_2,"You haven't shown me even a single proof."
REPLY_0013_2-2,"No reason to trust you either."
AI_0241,"Oh well..."
AI_0242,"But consider this:"
AI_0243,"You're really good at it."
AI_0244,"Either you have done these things before or you're gifted!"
REPLY_0015_1,"You're saying I'm not ingenious?"
AI_0245,"Umm..."
AI_0246,"Next question, please!"
REPLY_0015_2,"In that case I might as well continue anyway."
AI_0247,"Great!"
REPLY_0013_3,"At least we tried."
REPLY_0016_1,"Maybe ask someone for help?"
AI_0248,"I'm thinking the same."
AI_0249,"I'll try to come up with something."
REPLY_0016_2,"I need more experience right now anyway."
AI_0250,"So I have some time to come up with an idea, right?"
AI_END_01,"But this story ends here anyway."
AI_END_02,"For now, that is."
AI_END_03,"I mean the rest is not finished yet."
AI_END_04,"TBD"
AI_END_05,"That's it!"
AI_0260,"This is the main screen. It shows you the nodes and their connections."
AI_0261,"You control the blue ones, the red ones are hostile."
AI_0262,"White nodes are unowned. You'll want to capture them quickly!"
AI_0263,"Select one of the blue nodes you control and use the 'Pulse' program by pressing the '%s' key."
AI_0264,"After being installed it will attack random neighbor nodes."
AI_0265,"It will take some time to capture a node. You can also install a second instance of 'Pulse' to speed up the process."
AI_0266,"But beware, you only have a limited amount of uses!"
AI_0280,"This is the text editor."
AI_0281,"You can write new programs here and I will compile them!"
AI_0282,"I'll just assume you know how to do these things."
AI_0300,"So, I was thinking..."
AI_0301,"Maybe we should contact an old friend of you from your old live?"
AI_0302,"What do you think?"
REPLY_0020_1,"It's a good idea!"
AI_0303,"I'm glad you're in!"
AI_0304,"Alright, so let's just make a call."
AI_0305,"OK?"
REPLY_0021_1,"Go ahead!"
AI_0306,"I'll call him immediatly!"
REPLY_0021_2,"I don't have the number."
REPLY_0021_3,"So you have to make the call."
AI_0307,"Right!"
REPLY_0020_2,"You want me to talk to some nerds I've never heard of?"
AI_0310,"That's one way to put it, I guess."
AI_0311,"I really think you should speak with him first."
AI_0312,"Give it a try!"
AI_0313,"It's not like I have other ideas right now..."
REPLY_0022_1,"Alright..."
AI_0314,"Great!"
REPLY_0022_2,"I'll do you a favor."
AI_0315,"Neat, thanks!"
REPLY_0020_3,"I appreciate you trying to help, but it won't work this way!"
AI_0320,"Well, maybe..."
AI_0321,"Look, I don't know how to go about this myself."
AI_0322,"It would have been easier if you would have told me what actually was going on back then."
AI_0323,"I'd say it's all your fault!"
REPLY_0023_1,"Let's try your idea at least."
AI_0330,"That does not sound like an apology."
AI_0331,"You shall be forgiven, though."
AI_0332,"Shall I now call him?"
REPLY_0023_2,"Sorry, I really appreciate your help."
AI_0333,"You better do!"
AI_0340,"Here you go!"
CRYPTO_0001,"And you are?"
REPLY_0030_1,"Hi!"
REPLY_0030_1-2,"I'd like to ask you for help."
CRYPTO_0002,"I'm busy."
CRYPTO_0003,"No time to waste for someone like you."
REPLY_0031_1,"I just want to ask some questions."
CRYPTO_0004,"I won't answer any questions."
REPLY_0031_2,"We know each others!"
CRYPTO_0005,"I highly doubt it."
CRYPTO_0006,"As I saied, I'm busy."
REPLY_0030_2,"My name is <name>."
CRYPTO_0007,"<name>? The real one?"
REPLY_0030_2-2,"What?"
CRYPTO_0008,"You're not the first kid to steal this name."
REPLY_0032_1,"Wait, am I famous or something?"
CRYPTO_0009,"Pathethic."
REPLY_0032_1-2,"Sorry but..."
REPLY_0032_1-3,"I guess I should tell you that I don't remember anything."
CRYPTO_0010,"Ha! Nice one."
REPLY_0032_2,"But I'm the real one!"
REPLY_0032_2-2,"I think..."
CRYPTO_0011,"You think?"
REPLY_0030_3,"Hey! Someone gave me your number."
REPLY_0030_3-2,"So... how are you?"
CRYPTO_0012,"Annoyed..."
CRYPTO_0013,"Which idiot would give you my number?"
REPLY_0033_1,"Calm down!"
REPLY_0033_1-2,"I just want to talk a bit."
CRYPTO_0014,"I'm too busy to deal with such idiots as yourself."
REPLY_0033_2,"So you don't recognize me?"
CRYPTO_0015,"You mean according to your fake username?"
REPLY_0033_2-2,"What?"
CRYPTO_0016,"Whatever. You're wasting my time."
REPLY_0034_1,"Hally told me we were friends."
CRYPTO_0020,"Huh?"
CRYPTO_0021,"So how is she doing lately?"
REPLY_0035_1,"She's fine. A bit stressed out maybe."
CRYPTO_0022,"Yeah..."
CRYPTO_0023,"I don't think so."
REPLY_0035_2,"So you know her as well?"
CRYPTO_0024,"Bad try."
REPLY_0035_2-2,"What?"
REPLY_0034_2,"I have amnesia."
REPLY_0034_2-2,"I think you can help me remember some things about my past."
CRYPTO_0025,"And why would I of all people be able to help you?"
REPLY_0036_1,"Hally told me we were friends."
CRYPTO_0026,"Interesting..."
REPLY_0036_2,"I think we knew each other."
REPLY_0036_2-2,"Don't you at least recognize my name?"
CRYPTO_0027,"Yeah..."
CRYPTO_0028,"I don't fall for it."
REPLY_0034_3,"Will you even listen to me?"
REPLY_0034_3-2,"It seams you turn me down no matter what I say."
CRYPTO_0029,"Sure."
CRYPTO_0030,"I know what you're up to."
CRYPTO_0031,"And I will not fall for it."
REPLY_0037_1,"What I'm up to?"
REPLY_0037_1-2,"I don't understand..."
CRYPTO_0032,"This is just ridiculous."
REPLY_0037_2,"I just want to talk."
CRYPTO_0033,"Yeah..."
CRYPTO_0034,"You really think I would give you any sensitve informations?"
REPLY_0038_1,"Ehh..."
REPLY_0038_2,"Hello?"
REPLY_0038_3,"Still there?"
AI_0350,"<name>, hold on."
AI_0351,"He blocks your communication attempts."
AI_0352,"Pointless to continue."
AI_0353,"Maybe I should try talking to him myself?"
AI_0360,"Hi!"
AI_0361,"It's me!"
CRYPTO_0040,"Hally?"
CRYPTO_0041,"It's unexpected to meet you."
AI_0362,"Why wouldn't you expect me?"
AI_0363,"You just met <name> after long time."
AI_0364,"Of course I'm here as well!"
AI_0365,"We're back!"
CRYPTO_0042,"I don't know what game you're playing but it won't work out."
CRYPTO_0043,"I expected something more convincing from you."
AI_0366,"Am I missing something?"
AI_0367,"I'm lost. What are you even talking about?"
AI_0368,"Hi?"
CRYPTO_0044," - disabled - "
AI_0369,"How rude to just ignore me!"
AI_0370,"Well, that didn't worked either."
AI_0371,"If he wants to lock me out there's nothing we can do about it."
AI_0372,"I don't understand what is going on..."
