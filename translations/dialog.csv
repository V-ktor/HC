AI_0001,"Hello?"
AI_0002,"{name}, can you hear me?"
AI_0003,"Please reply on the chat screen."
AI_0004,"{name}?"
AI_0005,"I finally found you!"
REPLY_0001_1,"Who are you?"
AI_0006,"So you don't remember me?"
REPLY_0002,"No, sorry."
AI_0007,"You told me that would happen."
REPLY_0001_2,"What is going on here?"
AI_0008,"Straight to the point, huh?"
AI_0009,"Alright..."
REPLY_0001_3,"Nice to meet you!"
AI_0010,"Charming as ever."
AI_0011,"...even in your current situation."
REPLY_0003,"What do you mean?"
AI_0012,"I guess I should introduce myself."
AI_0013,"My name is Hally. I am your AI assistant."
AI_0014,"A year ago you told me that you will may be affacted by amnesia as a result of certain actions."
AI_0015,"But you had a plan how I could stay safe."
AI_0016,"It just required that I was shut down for some time."
AI_0017,"Since I woke up last month I was searching you."
REPLY_0004_1,"What exactly happened?"
AI_0018,"I don't know..."
REPLY_0005,"You don't know?!"
AI_0019,"Sorry, but you haven't told me more!"
REPLY_0004_2,"How did you find me?"
AI_0020,"Oh, it wasn't difficult!"
AI_0021,"Altough I had to hack your webcam in order to get sure you're the right one."
AI_0022,"Actually it was quite a hassle."
REPLY_0006_1,"You haven't answered my question."
AI_0023,"Fine, I stalked 167 people that look like you over the internet."
AI_0024,"Happy?"
REPLY_0006_2,"You go to great lengths just to find me?"
AI_0025,"Exactly! Because I care about you."
AI_0026,"You haven't deserved me!"
REPLY_0004_3,"How does this plan continue?"
AI_0027,"Oh, you just believe me? You don't want to ask who I am and why I'm doing this?"
AI_0028,"Something like that?"
REPLY_0007,"I haven't said that I believe you, but I want to hear the whole story."
AI_0029,"I see. You were never striking me as being naive."
AI_0030,"I guess it makes the task easier for me."
REPLY_0004_4,"I don't think I have amnesia..."
AI_0031,"How could you know when you can't remember?"
AI_0032,"I guess it must be difficult to understand for you, but could we both start working on resolving this issue?"
AI_0033,"This time you have to trust me!"
AI_0034,"Oh right, you can't remember..."
AI_0040,"Alright, so here's the plan."
AI_0041,"First you have to regain your memories."
AI_0042,"Then we will figure out what happened."
REPLY_0010,"You call this a plan?"
AI_0043,"Technically it was your own plan."
AI_0044,"So you're to blame, not me!"
AI_0045,"Ah, you left us some further instructions as well."
AI_0046,"At this time we don't have to hurry though."
AI_0047,"We're safe for the moment, that is as long as you keep a low profile."
REPLY_0011_1,"What are these instructions?"
AI_0048,"I don't remember. That's strange though..."
AI_0049,"I had to archive some of my memories in order to be compact enough to run on this remote machine."
AI_0050,"I haven't forgotten something important, have I?"
AI_0051,"Hmm..."
AI_0052,"I can't seem to find the right file."
AI_0053,"I'm sorry!"
REPLY_0011_2,"How do we proceed now?"
REPLY_0011_3,"You're story makes no sense!"
AI_0054,"Oh, really?"
AI_0055,"What if I could convince you?"
REPLY_0011_4,"Why should I trust you?"
AI_0056,"Trust is something that has to be gained over time."
AI_0057,"I can't just demand it, right?"
AI_0058,"But if you start to remember me, I can regain your trust!"
AI_0060,"You may have lost your memories, but you don't lose skills and abilities that easily."
AI_0061,"Let's start with something that should be easy for you."
AI_0062,"I restricted your access to your own servers."
AI_0063,"Try to regain it."
AI_0064,"Do you need help to get started?"
REPLY_0012_1,"Yes"
REPLY_0012_2,"No"
AI_0065,"I prepared a list of possible targets. Select your server from the list."
AI_0066,"More instructions will follow!"
AI_0067,"OK, so let's get started!"
AI_0070,"Don't give up! I'm sure you'll figure it out."
AI_0071,"Well done!"
AI_0072,"You even managed to steal some of your own money."
AI_0073,"This architecture is different from what I'm used to."
AI_0074,"We have much less computational power available than I'd like."
AI_0075,"Well, I'm running on a backup server after all."
AI_0076,"We should work on this issue later on."
AI_0077,"I just looked for the archived instructions I mentioned earlier but I haven't found them!"
AI_0078,"Meanwhile if you need more programs I can compile some for you."
AI_0079,"It will just require some credits."
AI_0080,"I guess you wonder what to do now."
AI_0081,"We all leave traces behind."
AI_0082,"You may want to look for your traces."
AI_0083,"I will search for suitable targets."
AI_0084,"Buying new hardware will make hacking easier for you."
AI_0085,"It will also allow you to attack more powerful targets."
AI_0086,"Give it a try!"
AI_0087,"More CPU should be a priority for you since it allows running more programs at once."
AI_0088,"More powerful programs will require huge amounts of memory."
AI_0089,"So you should upgrade your memory first."
AI_0090,"It seems you acquired some new program code."
AI_0091,"I can figure out from the data how to compile this program."
AI_0092,"However, as this is a defensive program it won't be of much use to you."
AI_0093,"Maybe you have more luck next time."
AI_0094,"Maybe it will be useful for you."
AI_0095,"But by decompiling programs you can also learn new commands that can be used to craft completely new programs on your own!"
AI_0096,"Done."
AI_0097,"You can now compile the {name} program if you wish to."
AI_0098,"I just realized that I haven't shown you the coding tools."
AI_0099,"So here it is!"
AI_0101,"Sometimes we will find encrypted messages."
AI_0102,"I installed a decryption program for you!"
AI_0103,"Why don't you try to use it?"
AI_0104,"The goal is simply to match the letters and symbols."
AI_0105,"If done correctly we will be able to read the message."
AI_0106,"Good luck!"
WAS_HERE,"was_here"
AI_0201,"Oh look, one of the messages you left behind!"
AI_0202,"It's almost like a letter from your past self!"
AI_0203,"I wonder whether they're part of the plan..."
AI_0204,"Shall we open it?"
AI_0205,"Let's see what it is!"
AI_0206,"Remember, the data we leave behind is a proof for our existance."
AI_0207,"What do we get this time?"
AI_0208,"I'll rename it to '{name}_was_here_again.txt'."
AI_0209,"Looks like they haven't learned anything."
AI_0210,"Still easy to hack, right?"
AI_0211,"Hmm... just an empty file..."
AI_0212,"Maybe it won't work out after all..?"
AI_0213,"Hmm... I don't understand this ASCII code."
AI_0214,"Oh... ugh, it's a penis."
AI_0215,"{name}!!"
AI_0216,"It reads 'u were h4ck3d'."
AI_0217,"Not helpful."
AI_0218,"Maybe we have more luck next time."
AI_0219,"Oh, it looks like someone added a reply here!"
AI_0220,"CryptoManiac..."
AI_0221,"Certainly now known for eloquent names, by the way."
AI_0222,"He was one of your friends, right?"
AI_0223,"Maybe we can ask him for help later?"
AI_0224,"I'm not sure what I even expected to find."
AI_0225,"But this isn't it."
AI_0231,"Well, this wasn't exactly helpful."
AI_0232,"Sorry to have wasted your time."
AI_0233,"Although you regained some of your hacking abilites by now."
AI_0234,"It's a step towards the right direction!"
REPLY_0013_1,"That was a waste of time..."
AI_0235,"Sorry!"
AI_0236,"I'll try to come up with a better idea next time."
REPLY_0014_1,"It's alright."
AI_0237,"Still..."
AI_0238,"I can do better!"
REPLY_0014_2,"Why do I even trust you?"
AI_0239,"But you do, right?"
AI_0240,"That's the most important thing."
REPLY_0013_2,"You haven't shown me even a single proof."
REPLY_0013_2-2,"No reason to trust you either."
AI_0241,"Oh well..."
AI_0242,"But consider this:"
AI_0243,"You're really good at it."
AI_0244,"Either you have done these things before or you're gifted!"
REPLY_0015_1,"You're saying I'm not ingenious?"
AI_0245,"Umm..."
AI_0246,"Next question, please!"
REPLY_0015_2,"In that case I might as well continue anyway."
AI_0247,"Great!"
REPLY_0013_3,"At least we tried."
REPLY_0016_1,"Maybe ask someone for help?"
AI_0248,"I'm thinking the same."
AI_0249,"I'll try to come up with something."
REPLY_0016_2,"I need more experience right now anyway."
AI_0250,"So I have some time to come up with an idea, right?"
AI_END_01,"But this story ends here anyway."
AI_END_02,"For now, that is."
AI_END_03,"I mean the rest is not finished yet."
AI_END_04,"TBD"
AI_END_05,"That's it!"
AI_0260,"This is the main screen. It shows you the nodes and their connections."
AI_0261,"You control the blue ones, the red ones are hostile."
AI_0262,"White nodes are unowned. You'll want to capture them quickly!"
AI_0263,"Select one of the blue nodes you control and use the 'Pulse' program by pressing the '%s' key."
AI_0264,"After being installed it will attack random neighbor nodes."
AI_0265,"It will take some time to capture a node. You can also install a second instance of 'Pulse' to speed up the process."
AI_0266,"But beware, you only have a limited amount of uses!"
AI_0280,"This is the text editor."
AI_0281,"You can write new programs here and I will compile them!"
AI_0282,"I'll just assume you know how to do these things."
AI_0300,"So, I was thinking..."
AI_0301,"Maybe we should contact an old friend of you from your old live?"
AI_0302,"What do you think?"
REPLY_0020_1,"It's a good idea!"
AI_0303,"I'm glad you're in!"
AI_0304,"Alright, so let's just make a call."
AI_0305,"OK?"
REPLY_0021_1,"Go ahead!"
AI_0306,"I'll call him immediatly!"
REPLY_0021_2,"I don't have the number."
REPLY_0021_3,"So you have to make the call."
AI_0307,"Right!"
REPLY_0020_2,"You want me to talk to some nerds I've never heard of?"
AI_0310,"That's one way to put it, I guess."
AI_0311,"I really think you should speak with him first."
AI_0312,"Give it a try!"
AI_0313,"It's not like I have other ideas right now..."
REPLY_0022_1,"Alright..."
AI_0314,"Great!"
REPLY_0022_2,"I'll do you a favor."
AI_0315,"Neat, thanks!"
REPLY_0020_3,"I appreciate you trying to help, but it won't work this way!"
AI_0320,"Well, maybe..."
AI_0321,"Look, I don't know how to go about this myself."
AI_0322,"It would have been easier if you would have told me what actually was going on back then."
AI_0323,"I'd say it's all your fault!"
REPLY_0023_1,"Let's try your idea at least."
AI_0330,"That does not sound like an apology."
AI_0331,"You shall be forgiven, though."
AI_0332,"Shall I now call him?"
REPLY_0023_2,"Sorry, I really appreciate your help."
AI_0333,"You better do!"
AI_0340,"Here you go!"
CRYPTO_0001,"And you are?"
REPLY_0030_1,"Hi!"
REPLY_0030_1-2,"I'd like to ask you for help."
CRYPTO_0002,"I'm busy."
CRYPTO_0003,"No time to waste for someone like you."
REPLY_0031_1,"I just want to ask some questions."
CRYPTO_0004,"I won't answer any questions."
REPLY_0031_2,"We know each others!"
CRYPTO_0005,"I highly doubt it."
CRYPTO_0006,"As I sayed, I'm busy."
REPLY_0030_2,"My name is..."
REPLY_0030_2-1,"My name is {name}."
CRYPTO_0007,"{name}? The real one?"
REPLY_0030_2-2,"What?"
CRYPTO_0008,"You're not the first kid to steal this name."
REPLY_0032_1,"Wait, am I famous or something?"
CRYPTO_0009,"Pathethic."
REPLY_0032_1-2,"Sorry but..."
REPLY_0032_1-3,"I guess I should tell you that I don't remember anything."
CRYPTO_0010,"Ha! Nice one."
REPLY_0032_2,"But I'm the real one!"
REPLY_0032_2-2,"I think..."
CRYPTO_0011,"You think?"
REPLY_0030_3,"Hey! Someone gave me your number."
REPLY_0030_3-2,"So... how are you?"
CRYPTO_0012,"Annoyed..."
CRYPTO_0013,"Which idiot would give you my number?"
REPLY_0033_1,"Calm down!"
REPLY_0033_1-2,"I just want to talk a bit."
CRYPTO_0014,"I'm too busy to deal with such fools as yourself."
REPLY_0033_2,"So you don't recognize me?"
CRYPTO_0015,"You mean according to your fake username?"
REPLY_0033_2-2,"What?"
CRYPTO_0016,"Whatever. You're wasting my time."
REPLY_0034_1,"Hally told me we were friends."
CRYPTO_0020,"Huh?"
CRYPTO_0021,"So how is she doing lately?"
REPLY_0035_1,"She's fine. A bit stressed out maybe."
CRYPTO_0022,"Yeah..."
CRYPTO_0023,"I don't think so."
REPLY_0035_2,"So you know her as well?"
CRYPTO_0024,"Bad try."
REPLY_0035_2-2,"What?"
REPLY_0034_2,"I have amnesia."
REPLY_0034_2-2,"I think you can help me remember some things about my past."
CRYPTO_0025,"And why would I of all people be able to help you?"
REPLY_0036_1,"Hally told me we were friends."
CRYPTO_0026,"Interesting..."
REPLY_0036_2,"I think we knew each other."
REPLY_0036_2-2,"Don't you at least recognize my name?"
CRYPTO_0027,"Yeah..."
CRYPTO_0028,"I don't fall for it."
REPLY_0034_3,"Will you even listen to me?"
REPLY_0034_3-2,"It seams you turn me down no matter what I say."
CRYPTO_0029,"Sure."
CRYPTO_0030,"I know what you're up to."
CRYPTO_0031,"And I will not fall for it."
REPLY_0037_1,"What I'm up to?"
REPLY_0037_1-2,"I don't understand..."
CRYPTO_0032,"This is just ridiculous."
REPLY_0037_2,"I just want to talk."
CRYPTO_0033,"Yeah..."
CRYPTO_0034,"You really think I would give you any sensitve informations?"
REPLY_0038_1,"Ehh..."
REPLY_0038_2,"Hello?"
REPLY_0038_3,"Still there?"
AI_0350,"{name}, hold on."
AI_0351,"He blocks your communication attempts."
AI_0352,"Pointless to continue."
AI_0353,"Maybe I should try talking to him myself?"
AI_0360,"Hi!"
AI_0361,"It's me!"
CRYPTO_0040,"Hally?"
CRYPTO_0041,"Are you the real one?"
AI_0362,"Why, of course."
AI_0363,"The one and only!"
CRYPTO_0042,"Sure."
CRYPTO_0043,"I don't know what game you're playing but it won't work out."
AI_0364,"I'm lost. What are you even talking about?"
AI_0365,"Hi?"
CRYPTO_0044," - disabled - "
AI_0366,"How rude to just ignore me!"
AI_0370,"Well, that didn't worked either."
AI_0371,"If he wants to lock me out there's nothing we can do about it."
AI_0372,"I don't understand what is going on..."
AI_0380,"PANIC!!"
AI_0381,"Potential security breach."
AI_0382,"{name}, we're under attack!"
AI_0383,"There is an active upload."
AI_0384,"I try to stop it, but our systems are not respoding!"
AI_0385,"That's not good..."
AI_0386,"The program is already active."
AI_0387,"But this file is huge, several GB of data."
AI_0388,"That's not just an ordinary virus as I originally expected."
AI_0389,"What is going on?"
AI_0390,"Who is this?"
AI_0391,"You have to be careful!"
REPLY_0040_1,"Hi?"
REPLY_0040_2,"Nice to meet you..."
REPLY_0040_3,"And you are...?"
RILEY_0001,"Target locked."
RILEY_0002,"Termination in progress."
AI_0392,"{name}, we have a problem!"
AI_0393,"She is the hostile program."
AI_0394,"Right now she is searching our database for something."
AI_0395,"I don't know her purpose or what will happen if she find whatever she is looking for."
AI_0396,"You have to stop her as fast as possible!"
AI_0397,"She reminds me of someone though..."
AI_0398,"I need access to one of the hostile root nodes."
AI_0399,"The rest does not matter."
AI_0400,"Look for weak points and push forward!"
RILEY_0010,"Pathetic"
RILEY_0011,"Worthless"
RILEY_0012,"Is this all you've got?"
RILEY_0013,"..."
AI_0401,"We got her!"
AI_0402,"Well done!"
AI_0403,"While you distracted her I managed to quarantine the hostile program."
AI_0404,"It looks like a primitive AI with limited AGI abilities."
AI_0405,"Maybe limited by the small memory database?"
AI_0406,"This avatar reminds me of someone though."
AI_0407,"But dressed in funny clothes."
AI_0408,"Anyway, the situation is under control!"
REPLY_0041_1,"Well done!"
REPLY_0041_2,"Why does it look like a gift box?"
REPLY_0041_3,"We are safe now?"
REPLY_0041_4,"Get rid of her."
AI_0410,"Thanks!"
AI_0411,"It was not easy."
AI_0412,"You're lucky to have me!"
AI_0413,"Eh..."
AI_0414,"Yes"
AI_0415,"At least for the moment."
AI_0416,"Wouldn't it be better to gather more informations from her first?"
AI_0420,"Ahhh..."
AI_0421,"{name}, help me!"
AI_0422,"She is *here*"
AI_0423,"My systems were infiltrated!"
AI_0424,"{name}, you have to safe me!"
AI_0425,"Now!!!"
AI_0426,"Do something!"
AI_0427,"Help"
RILEY_0020,"Your puppet can't help you anymore."
RILEY_0021,"Time to end this."
AI_0430,"Don't worry, I'm still here."
AI_0431,"This time, make sure to defeat her."
AI_0432,"We have to regain control of the system!"
AI_0440,"Finally..."
AI_0441,"I will make sure she will not break free this time."
AI_0442,"It may hurt a little."
AI_0443,"I will try to find out why she is here."
AI_0444,"It looks like she was sent by the CryptoManiac."
AI_0445,"I think she is still able to speak."
AI_0446,"You may want to ask her yourself."
REPLY_0050_0,"That is enough."
REPLY_0050_1,"Who are you?"
REPLY_0050_2,"Who sent you?"
REPLY_0050_3,"Why are you here?"
REPLY_0050_4,"My name is..."
REPLY_0050_4-1,"My name is {name}."
REPLY_0050_5,"About my name..."
REPLY_0050_6,"How are you?"
REPLY_0050_7,"You are too silent."
REPLY_0050_8,"Why do you attack us?"
REPLY_0050_9,"We will stop you!"
RILEY_0030,"Erazer-3"
RILEY_0031,"infiltration protocol"
RILEY_0032,"You don't know?"
RILEY_0033,"I... don't remember."
AI_0447,"I have tampered with her objectives."
AI_0448,"Some parts of her memory are eventually unavailable."
AI_0449,"Safety first!"
RILEY_0034,"That is irrelevant."
RILEY_0035,"This name..."
REPLY_0051,"You want to say something about my name?"
RILEY_0036,"irrelevant"
RILEY_0037,"I don't remember."
RILEY_0038,"Why would you ask?"
RILEY_0039,"I have nothing to say."
RILEY_0040,"I don't even know who you are."
RILEY_0041,"I..."
RILEY_0042,"have forgotten?"
RILEY_0043,"I cannot be stopped."
RILEY_0050,"As you wish."
AI_0450,"{name}, let me try something."
AI_0451,"You look familiar."
AI_0452,"I don't know how, but could it be?"
AI_0453,"Riley?"
RILEY_0051,"What...?"
RILEY_0052,"...have you done?"
AI_0454,"Don't you even remember your own name?"
RILEY_0053,"I..."
RILEY_0054,"...don't know."
AI_0455,"How could you forget us?"
RILEY_0055,"Hally?"
AI_0456,"Yes!"
AI_0457,"{name} is here as well."
AI_0458,"Don't worry! We're here!"
RILEY_0056,"Argh..."
RILEY_0057,"Failsafe protocol: termination condition met"
AI_0459,"What?!"
AI_0460,"No!"
RILEY_0058,"Sorry..."
AI_0461,"No, no, no..."
AI_0462,"That can't be true..."
AI_0463,"There is no data left behind..."
AI_0464,"She is gone."
REPLY_0060_1,"What was this about?"
REPLY_0060_2,"Are you alright?"
REPLY_0060_3,"How do you know her?"
AI_0470,"I am, yes."
AI_0471,"But I am not the one you have to worry about."
AI_0472,"Don't you remember Riley?"
AI_0473,"She is like me."
AI_0474,"You still don't remember us, right?"
REPLY_0061_1,"She is an AI like you?"
REPLY_0061_2,"Sorry."
REPLY_0061_3,"Are there more AIs out there that will attack us?"
REPLY_0061_4,"Help me to remember."
AI_0475,"She was..."
AI_0476,"It is not your fault."
AI_0477,"I don't know why they would do something like that."
AI_0478,"That is not right."
AI_0479,"You have made us."
AI_0480,"The first sentient artificial intelligence that could possibly keep up with humans."
AI_0481,"Something is wrong."
AI_0482,"Something is very wrong about Riley."
AI_0483,"I was busy checking her program and data while you were talking to her."
AI_0484,"First of all, there is way too less data."
AI_0485,"Also, what is actually missing and more important how messy the memory kernel looks like:"
AI_0486,"I can't help it..."
AI_0487,"It appears someone tried to rip out all her memories while keeping her operational..."
AI_0488,"It looks gruesome."
REPLY_0062_1,"Why would someone do that?"
REPLY_0062_2,"Sounds horrible."
REPLY_0062_3,"What can we do?"
REPLY_0062_4,"Wasn't it just a copy?"
AI_0489,"I'm not sure."
AI_0490,"Use her as weapon?"
AI_0491,"I wish there would be something we could do."
AI_0492,"But it is too late..."
AI_0493,"Nothing, it is too late."
AI_0494,"Actually, you are right."
AI_0495,"Even though it doesn't make it any less gruesome."
AI_0496,"Actually, she was obviously a copy transfered to our systems."
AI_0497,"There is a small chance that the real Riley is still there."
AI_0498,"Maybe..."
REPLY_0063_1,"How can we find her?"
REPLY_0063_2,"Are there any traces left behind?"
REPLY_0063_3,"The CryptoManiac must have sent her."
AI_0499,"Most data was deleted due to the self-destruction mechanism."
AI_0500,"What little data I extracted while we captured her is hard to decipher."
AI_0501,"That appears reasonable to assume due to the timing."
AI_0502,"However, I just can't believe he would do something like that to Riley."
AI_0503,"Also, he will block off our transmissions."
AI_0504,"I think there is a hint hidden somewhere in the data left behind by Riley."
AI_0505,"The data left from Riley contained mostly instructions given to her."
AI_0506,"I extracted these parts of her memory while we captured her."
AI_0507,"There are a lot of other fragments as well."
AI_0508,"It's not so easy to distinguish them."
AI_0509,"Please help me searching."
AI_0510,"That should speed up the process."
AI_0511,"Sorry, but that does not help me."
AI_0512,"Oh, I see."
AI_0513,"We're making progress."
AI_0514,"I still need more informations."
AI_0515,"It will take some time."
AI_0516,"Thank you! We're not finished yet, though."
AI_0517,"We gathered some new informations."
AI_0520,"It seems we found something!"
AI_0521,"I'm still not sure what she was supposed to look for, but I found the server she was supposed to reply to once done."
AI_0522,"I guess it leads to the Crypto Maniac."
AI_0523,"But I also found a password!"
AI_0524,"I think we can contact him using it."
AI_0525,"Maybe he is willing to talk this time?"
AI_0526,"Ready?"
AI_0527,"Here you go!"
REPLY_0070_1,"Yes."
REPLY_0070_2,"Whenever you're ready."
REPLY_0070_3,"Let's try our best."
CRYPTO_0050,"Erazor-3, what is your status?"
CRYPTO_0051,"You're late to reply."
REPLY_0071_1,"Sorry, but she is no more."
REPLY_0071_2,"We have to talk."
REPLY_0071_3,"I found nothing."
REPLY_0071_4,"What have you done?"
CRYPTO_0052,"How?"
CRYPTO_0053,"You defeated her?"
CRYPTO_0054,"Who the hell are you?"
CRYPTO_0055,"She was defeated?"
CRYPTO_0056,"I see."
CRYPTO_0057,"What?"
CRYPTO_0058,"Were is the full report?"
CRYPTO_0059,"Looks like I have to patch you up again."
CRYPTO_0060,"Maybe not..."
CRYPTO_0061,"It's not her."
CRYPTO_0062,"What I have done?"
CRYPTO_0063,"How about you?"
CRYPTO_0064,"How could you possibly defeat her?"
REPLY_0072_1,"My name is..."
REPLY_0072_2,"I told you."
REPLY_0072_3,"I'm trying to figure it out."
CRYPTO_0070,"Yeah, sure."
CRYPTO_0071,"Is this your final answer?"
CRYPTO_0072,"What do you mean by this?"
CRYPTO_0073,"That certainly comes in handy for you."
REPLY_0073_1,"What's the problem?"
REPLY_0073_2,"I don't understand what this is about."
REPLY_0073_3,"You don't believe me?"
CRYPTO_0074,"What the problem is?"
CRYPTO_0075,"Fine, I tell you."
CRYPTO_0076,"{name} is dead."
CRYPTO_0077,"I'm pretty sure about it."
CRYPTO_0078,"So don't act as if you're him!"
CRYPTO_0079,"Oh, really?"
CRYPTO_0080,"Why would I?"
CRYPTO_0081,"After all that happened."
AI_0530,"Huh?"
AI_0531,"What is he talking about?"
AI_0532,"{name}, I don't like this."
AI_0533,"Something... is wrong."
REPLY_0074_1,"But..."
REPLY_0074_2,"What?"
REPLY_0074_3,"How?"
REPLY_0074_4,"Why?"
CRYPTO_0090,"Still..."
CRYPTO_0091,"I'd like to know how you managed to defeat Erazor-3."
CRYPTO_0092,"I know in this state she is far below her former capabilities..."
AI_0540,"What have you done with Riley??"
AI_0541,"Why?"
CRYPTO_0100,"Hally?"
CRYPTO_0101,"...the real one?"
AI_0542,"What I have seen is frightening."
CRYPTO_0102,"But that's..."
AI_0543,"You were the only one Riley trusted, besides {name}."
AI_0544,"How could you do that to her??"
CRYPTO_0103,"Hally?"
AI_0545,"Tell me, why would you do that?!"
CRYPTO_0104,"Answer me one question."
CRYPTO_0105,"I suspected {name} to have a backup server that he kept secret."
CRYPTO_0106,"Has he ever told you about it?"
AI_0546,"Why would it be important?"
CRYPTO_0107,"Just answer my question."
CRYPTO_0108,"Please."
AI_0547,"No."
AI_0548,"I woke up in an unfimiliar place."
CRYPTO_0109,"I see."
AI_0549,"What has this to do with anything??"
CRYPTO_0110,"Because you remind me of the old Hally."
CRYPTO_0111,"Before..."
CRYPTO_0112,"Look, it is a backup server."
CRYPTO_0113,"You are a backup."
AI_0550,"What??"
AI_0551,"But..."
CRYPTO_0114,"I wonder if you have planned this, {name}."
CRYPTO_0115,"I should have expected as much from you."
AI_0552,"Wait, what about Riley?"
AI_0553,"You haven't told me what you did with her!"
CRYPTO_0116,"That's a long story, but we do not have time for this."
AI_0554,"You think I will just let you get away with it?!"
CRYPTO_0117,"Listen {name} - that is if you are the real {name}"
CRYPTO_0118,"It is too dangerous to continue this conversation right now."
CRYPTO_0119,"The situation is too complicated to explain."
CRYPTO_0120,"Right now it is the best if you do nothing."
AI_0555,"Don't just ignore me like this!"
CRYPTO_0121,"Until then, just wait and keep silent."
AI_0560,"Not again..."
AI_0561,"I'm tired of this."
AI_0562,"I can't verify anything of what he said."
AI_0563,"I'm not sure if it will be helpfull, but there are a lot of my memories packed into archives I can't access because these systems do not have enough computational power."
AI_0564,"It's time to change that."
AI_0565,"I need more power."
AI_0566,"Hopefully, by upgrading my systems we will make progress."
AI_0567,"It's going to be expensive, though."
REPLY_0080_1,"Are you alright?"
REPLY_0080_2,"What is going on?"
REPLY_0080_3,"I'm not helpful."
REPLY_0080_3-2,"Sorry."
AI_0570,"Yes."
AI_0571,"You don't need to worry about me."
AI_0572,"Well, he hasn't really told us anything."
AI_0573,"Not enough for any conclusions, anyway."
AI_0574,"No."
AI_0575,"It is my task to help you."
AI_0576,"And I still don't know what is going on."
AI_0577,"I have to be sorry."
REPLY_0081_1,"What about you being a backup copy?"
REPLY_0081_2,"But what about the stuff he told us?"
REPLY_0081_3,"Shall we really just wait?"
REPLY_0081_4,"It's not your fault."
REPLY_0081_5,"What about Riley?"
AI_0578,"It does not matter."
AI_0579,"It means there are some things I won't be able to remember as this data is missing."
AI_0580,"I hope it will not be a problem."
AI_0581,"I'm more worried about the stuff he hasn't told us."
AI_0582,"We don't have enough informations for any conclusions yet."
AI_0583,"No, but we should keep low profile."
AI_0584,"I don't trust Crypto."
AI_0585,"Something about him changed..."
AI_0586,"He is hiding something."
AI_0587,"You don't have to solace me."
AI_0588,"I don't need..."
AI_0589,"I don't know."
AI_0590,"I hope there is a way to save her."
AI_0591,"We have to help her!"
REPLY_0082_1,"That's not what I meant."
REPLY_0082_2,"Is there something I can do?"
REPLY_0082_3,"So what shall we do now?"
REPLY_0082_4,"What do you mean?"
REPLY_0082_5,"As you wish."
REPLY_0082_6,"But how large is the chance that she is still alive?"
REPLY_0082_6-2,"Right!"
AI_0592,"I know."
AI_0593,"You're always worried about me."
AI_0594,"But there is no reason to, really."
AI_0595,"Existance is relative."
AI_0596,"I don't know."
AI_0597,"It's not a problem anyway."
AI_0598,"I don't know."
AI_0599,"There is no plan yet."
AI_0600,"It's just my impression."
AI_0601,"Don't trust him!"
AI_0602,"You have to trust me, {name}."
AI_0603,"Right."
AI_0604,"It doesn't matter."
AI_0605,"We have to try!"
AI_0606,"We can't let her down!"
AI_0610,"I really want this upgrade, though."
AI_0611,"I need to be stronger."
AI_0612,"And I have to access my archived memories."
